# (Fill in the Missing Code?) Replace the ***s in the seconds_since_midnight function so that
# it returns the number of seconds since midnight. The function should receive
# three integers representing the current time of day. Assume that the hour is a value from
# 0 (midnight) through 23 (11 PM) and that the minute and second are values from 0 to 59.
# Test your function with actual times. For example, if you call the function for 1:30:45 PM
# by passing 13, 30 and 45, the function should return 48645.

# write a Python function (pig_latin) that takes a string as input,
# assumed to be an English word. The function should return the translation of this word
# into Pig Latin. You may assume that the word contains no capital letters or punctuation.

# def pig_latin(word):
#     if word[0] in 'aeiou':
#         return f'{word}way'
#     return f'{word[1:]}{word[0]}ay'

# Given that weâ€™re trying to retrieve the first and last elements of sequence and then
# join them together, it might seem reasonable to grab them both (via indexes) and
# then add them together:

# def first_last(sequence):
#     return sequence[:1] + sequence[-1:]
# t1 = ('chidi', 'janes', 'gideon', 'mark')
# names = first_last(t1)
# print(f'{names}')
#
# t2 = (1,2,3,4,27)
# numbers = first_last(t2)
# print(numbers)me
